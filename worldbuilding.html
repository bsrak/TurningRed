                <p2>“Chunky Cute”</p2>
                <p3>Set in Toronto, Canada, during the early 2000s, “Turning Red” gave the artists and filmmakers responsible for building the environments a clear jumping-off point: Toronto is a real place, after all. But while the city’s recognizable skyline, architecture style, street signs and Chinatown proved invaluable resources to filmmakers, their re-creation would be unique. For starters, it all had to be chunky cute. Says production designer Rona Liu, “We are looking at this world from a 13-year-old’s lens, so we rounded sharp corners and angles and didn’t taper shapes. Everything is round and pretty.”

                <p2>Toronto</p2>
                <p3>Toronto, Canada—hometown to director Domee Shi and the characters of “Turning
                    Red”—is featured prominently in the film, calling for specific nods to iconic locales. But compared
                    to the representation of New York City in “Soul,” “Turning Red” aims for a less realistic look. “It
                    feels more like a very soft, colorful, magical, idyllic, almost youthful version of the city,” says
                    executive producer Dan Scanlon.</p3>

            <p2 style="text-align: center;">Chinatown &<br> the Lee Family Temple</p2>
            <p3>To create the film’s representation of Chinatown and the Lee family’s ancestral temple, artists did
                extensive research—from careful analysis of two specific streets in Toronto’s real Chinatown to visiting
                the Asian Museum of San Francisco—and collaborated with a host of consultants. “Cultural authenticity
                was super important for us,” says director Domee Shi. “We took several trips to historic temples in
                California built by early Chinese settlers just to get a feeling of what these grassroots temples are
                like.”</p3>

                <p2>Home & Bedroom</p2>
                <p3>The Lees’ home is a perfect representation of the family’s Chinese Canadian lifestyle. And while Mei blends seamlessly into her household, joining mom and dad for homemade meals and watching TV alongside her mom, Mei’s growing pains come to light within the walls of her bedroom. At first glance, it is quite tidy for a teenager’s room. But—like Mei herself—there’s more to that story. Says sets art director Kristian Norelius, “I think she’s been trying to live up to her mom’s expectations by having everything sorted and organized. But hidden beneath the bed is evidence of her emerging self with new interests that she shares with her friends.”

                <p3>Several sequences take place within Mei’s middle school, showcasing her friendships and new interests away from her mother’s watchful eye (for the most part). Artists had to build the middle school with the film’s city setting in mind. Director Domee Shi pointed artists toward the school she attended—and sets supervisor Steve Karski actually found the blueprints for the school. “We used them as inspiration to see how an urban school in Toronto might be laid out,” he says.</p3>

            <p2>The Concert</p2>
            <p3>Mei and her friends are determined to attend the 4*Town concert, so filmmakers knew they’d need a spectacular venue for the occasion. Artists started with the actual dimensions of Toronto’s SkyDome, then played with the scale to find the sweet spot, allowing the climactic ending to unfold to its greatest potential.
                Effects supervisor Dave Hale and his team studied live concerts to help build the effects for the concert sequences. “We did a bunch of stage fog, pyrotechnics and vapor geysers,” says Hale.</p3>
